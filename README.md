# Science for a better world-CO2 emissions
At this repository I will collect analytical projects based on countries CO2 emissions.
Original sources available at https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home

You will find a prediction model for each country CO2 emissions, plus a clustering model for country CO2 emissions in 2019.

Feel free to contact me for anything you need to know related to these projects, or if looking for a partner for some project on this topic.
