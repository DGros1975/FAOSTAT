# Science for a better world
At this repository I will collect my professional and personal data science projects.
I am currently developing my portfolio in Data Science. You will find my projects at github, divided into social problems solving, business realted projects, and a third area of projects focused on basketball analytics.
Feel free to contact me for anything you need to know, or if looking for a partner for some project.
